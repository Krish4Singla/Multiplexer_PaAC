# Multiplexer_PaAC
MulProx4x4 is a Verilog-based implementation of a 4Ã—4 Approximate Multiplier, inspired by the principles discussed in the research article "Design and Analysis of Approximate Multipliers". This design employs approximation techniques to enhance speed and reduce power and area requirements, particularly suited for error-resilient applications such as image processing, machine learning inference, and digital signal processing.
